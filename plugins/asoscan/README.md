## What it is

ASOScan is App Store Optimization (ASO) software for iOS and Android apps, built and run by one app developer. This repo is the ASOScan plugin for ChatGPT and Claude and a skill pack for coding agents. Connect your ASOScan account and ask about your own apps in plain words.

- **App store ranking** and **Google Play store ASO**: your ASO score, ASOScan's recommendations and what to fix first.
- **App keywords**: app store keyword research with search volume and difficulty, keyword opportunities you could rank for, and tracking for the ones you pick.
- **Why is my app not showing in search**: where you rank for each tracked keyword and how the rank moved day by day.
- **ASO audit**: your current title, subtitle, keywords and description, what changed, and drafts for other languages.
- **App competitor analysis**: add a competitor by store link and see its keywords, category rank and rating history.
- **App review analysis**: sentiment, topics, bugs and feature requests, and AI reply drafts. A reply goes to the store only after you approve the exact text.

Good ASO improves organic rankings, and ASOScan helps you rank better. It does not promise a rank, does not publish listing text to the stores, and has no download or revenue data.

## ⚡ Quickstart

```bash
npx skills add ASOScan/aso-skills
```

Then just ask your agent, in plain language:

- *"How does App Store search ranking work?"* → answered instantly, **no API key needed**
- *"Where do I rank for my keywords, and which should I target next?"* → [add an API key](#set-up-an-api-key-coding-agents-without-the-connector) (API access depends on your plan; 7-day free trial)

⭐ **Useful? [Star the repo](https://github.com/ASOScan/aso-skills)**. It helps other developers find these skills.

Expert **App Store Optimization** in your AI workflow, powered by **real data**
from the [ASOScan](https://asoscan.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=aso-skills&utm_content=readme)
API: live keyword **volume + difficulty**, your app's **rank** (and its
history), **keyword opportunities**, **keyword spy**, **competitor + review**
intelligence, and a **metadata / ASO-score audit**.

Each skill packages an ASO framework, a scoring rubric, and an
output template. The agent reads the skill, pulls live numbers from your ASOScan
account, and gives you specific, actionable recommendations, not generic advice.

> Installed from the public repo **`ASOScan/aso-skills`** (GitHub org: ASOScan).

## Skills

| Skill | What it does |
|---|---|
| **asoscan-router** | Start here. Reads a natural-language ASO request, checks that the ASOScan tools are connected or an API key is set, and routes it to the right skill. |
| **aso-fundamentals** | Expert ASO best practices, keyword strategy, and golden tips. **Works with no API key**. |
| **asoscan-setup** | Guides connecting your ASOScan account or getting an API key, setting up webhooks (Slack/Teams), and connecting Play Console / App Store. **No API key needed**. |
| **keyword-intelligence** | Volume, difficulty, your rank & rank movement, rank/metrics history, and live keyword research. |
| **keyword-opportunities** | Gap-scored keyword suggestions worth targeting; can start tracking the winners. |
| **keyword-spy** | Reverse-lookup: every keyword an app ranks for (yours or a tracked competitor's). |
| **competitor-analysis** | Compare against tracked competitors; add a rival by store URL; category rank & rating history. |
| **review-insights** | Review sentiment + the top topics, feature requests, and bugs users mention. Drafts review replies and posts one only after you approve the exact text. |
| **metadata-audit** | Audits your listing (title/subtitle/description/keywords) with your ASOScan ASO score, drafts honest improvements, and drafts listing text for other languages. |

## What it can answer

Ask in plain language. The router picks the right skill. Examples it handles today:

- **Keyword intelligence**: "What's the volume and difficulty of *habit tracker*?" ·
  "Where do I rank for it, and is it moving?" · "Show my rank history." · "Research *sleep sounds*."
- **Suggestions**: "**Suggest keywords to track for my app.**" · "What keywords am I
  missing vs my competitors?" · "Track these for me."
- **Which keywords to use in the store**: "**Which keywords should I put in my
  title / subtitle / keyword field?**" (finds the terms, then drafts where they go,
  within Apple/Google limits).
- **Keyword spy**: "What keywords does my app rank for?" · "What does *\<a competitor
  I track\>* rank for that I don't?"
- **Competitors**: "Compare me to my competitors." · "**What category do my
  competitors use?**" · "Add *\<store URL\>* as a competitor." · "Am I gaining or
  losing in the category chart?"
- **Listing audit**: "What's my ASO score and how do I raise it?" · "Rewrite my
  subtitle." · "What changed in my listing?"
- **Reviews**: "What are users saying?" · "Top complaints / feature requests / bugs."
- **Learn ASO (no key needed)**: "How does App Store search work?" · "How do I write
  a good subtitle?" · "What's a solid keyword strategy?" · "Screenshot best practices?"
  (answered by **aso-fundamentals**, grounded in Apple/Google docs).
- **Set up & connect (no key needed)**: "How do I get my API key?" · "Set up webhooks
  / send alerts to Slack or Teams." · "Connect my Play Console / App Store app."
  (answered by **asoscan-setup**).

**Scope:** the **data** skills work on the apps in *your* ASOScan account (and
competitors you track) and need the ASOScan connector or an API key; the **aso-fundamentals** and
**asoscan-setup** skills work with no key. To analyze a rival, the skill first adds it
as a competitor by **store URL** (there's no lookup by app name).

**Not included:** pulling any app's keywords by name without adding it, download/revenue
estimates, Apple's secondary category, or generating listing copy without your data.

---

## Requirements

- An **ASOScan account** with at least one app (new accounts start with a 7-day free trial, no card needed).
- Either the **ASOScan plugin or connector** (ChatGPT, Claude, Claude Code), or an **API key** (`asosk_live_…`) for other agents. API access depends on your plan: see [asoscan.com/pricing](https://asoscan.com/pricing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=aso-skills&utm_content=readme).
- An Agent-Skills-compatible client that can make HTTP requests (Claude Code with
  Bash is the reference environment).

The **data** skills need a connection or a key. **aso-fundamentals** and **asoscan-setup** work with neither.

---

## Install

**ChatGPT (coming soon):** add **ASOScan** from the plugin directory, then sign in to ASOScan when ChatGPT asks.

**Claude, claude.ai / desktop / Cowork (coming soon):** add **ASOScan** from the directory, then sign in.

**Claude Code:**

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ASOScan/aso-skills
claude plugin install asoscan@asoscan
```

The plugin brings the skills and the ASOScan connector (`https://asoscan.com/mcp`); Claude Code asks you to sign in on first use.

**Any coding agent (skills only, API key):**

```bash
npx skills add ASOScan/aso-skills
# or a subset:
npx skills add ASOScan/aso-skills --skill keyword-intelligence keyword-spy
```

**Cursor:** Settings → Rules → Add Rule → Remote Rule (GitHub) → `https://github.com/ASOScan/aso-skills`

**Manual:** copy `skills/*` into your client's skills directory (for example `.claude/skills/`).

---

## Set up an API key (coding agents without the connector)

1. Create an account and add an app:
   [asoscan.com/auth/register](https://asoscan.com/auth/register?utm_source=github&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=aso-skills&utm_content=readme)
2. **Settings → API access → Create key** (choose *read* or *read + write*).
   Copy it. It is shown only once.
3. Export it:

   ```bash
   export ASOSCAN_API_KEY="asosk_live_XXXXXXXX..."
   ```

4. Verify: `bash scripts/asoscan-check.sh`

Full walkthrough: [`reference/onboarding.md`](reference/onboarding.md).

## How it works

- Each skill is **self-contained**: it names the ASOScan tool and the exact API call for each step (base
  URL, endpoints, response fields, error + credit handling) and reads your key from
  the `ASOSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable, so any skill installs and runs on its
  own. The [`reference/`](reference/) folder is the full human API reference, and
  [`evals/`](evals/) holds manual test scenarios.
- **Credit-aware:** each successful call spends credits from your monthly
  allowance; failed calls are free. Live keyword research (8 credits) is treated
  as expensive and cached within a session. `GET /usage` (free) shows what's left.
- **Owner-scoped:** to analyze a rival, the skill adds it as a competitor first,
  then reads its data.

## What this plugin sends

- With the connector: requests go to `https://asoscan.com/mcp` after you sign in with OAuth. You can disconnect any time in ASOScan under Settings → Connected AI apps.
- With an API key: the skills read `ASOSCAN_API_KEY` from your environment and send it only to `https://asoscan.com/api/public/v1` in the `Authorization` header. They never print it.
- Nothing else is sent anywhere. No package contains a credential.

## What's new in 1.3.0

- ChatGPT plugin (`plugin.json`, `mcp.json`) and Claude plugin and marketplace (`.claude-plugin/`, `.mcp.json`) from this one repo.
- Every data skill works with the ASOScan tools when they are connected, or with an API key when they are not.
- New: add an app, ASOScan recommendations, review reply drafts and posting (only after you approve the exact text), and listing drafts for other languages.

## Honesty

These skills present keyword volume/difficulty as clean numbers, never claim that
review replies or ads boost search ranking, and never fabricate reviews or
testimonials. Recommendations sell the outcome, not a mechanism.
