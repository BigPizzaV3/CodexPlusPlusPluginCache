# Bloom's Taxonomy for Programming

**Evidence tier: organizing framework.** A classification scheme, not an intervention with effect sizes — its value here is making "level" observable and consistent across skills, not a claimed learning gain.

## The 6 Levels

| Level | Name | Programming Indicators | Example Assessment |
|-------|------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Remember** | Recall syntax, name methods, recite definitions | "What keyword creates a variable in JavaScript?" |
| 2 | **Understand** | Explain code behavior, predict output, paraphrase concepts | "Explain what this function does in your own words" |
| 3 | **Apply** | Write code from requirements, use patterns in guided context | "Write a function that filters even numbers from an array" |
| 4 | **Analyze** | Debug code, compare approaches, identify performance issues | "This code has a bug when the array is empty. Find it." |
| 5 | **Evaluate** | Critique design decisions, justify choices, review code | "Which of these two implementations is better and why?" |
| 6 | **Create** | Design systems from scratch, build novel solutions, architect | "Design an API for a task management system" |

## Learner-Facing Rendering (canonical — every skill, not just `progress` skill)

The number is an instructor-facing instrument and so, by default, is the label. A learner reads the **outcome clause** — what they can do, phrased as application and reasoning — on its own: "you can apply it in working code with some guidance" is a position with a next step implied; "**Apply**" is a grade. The rung's name is spoken in exactly two places: (a) at the moment a learner **crosses** a rung (`record-review` reports `crossedLevel: true`; `progress` skill's growth line names a movement), because a named rung earned just now motivates, and (b) the `progress` skill full dashboard's one-line legend (`bloomScale`), so the words mean something when they do appear. Everywhere else: the clause alone.

| Level | Label | Outcome clause (second person) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | — | nothing observed yet (not rendered as a level — see *Unclassified is not a zero*) |
| 1 | **Remember** | you can recall the terms and what they refer to |
| 2 | **Understand** | you can explain what it does in your own words |
| 3 | **Apply** | you can apply it in working code with some guidance |
| 4 | **Analyze** | you can reason about why it behaves as it does and debug it on your own |
| 5 | **Evaluate** | you can weigh approaches and defend a design choice |
| 6 | **Create** | you can design something new with it and teach it |

Rendering rule: the clause alone — `you can apply it in working code with some guidance` — from `bloomOutcome`. At a crossing, the label joins it: "That moves you to **Apply** — you can apply it in working code with some guidance." Movement reads as words, never "2 → 3". `bodhi-state` returns `bloomLabel` and `bloomOutcome` next to every `bloomLevel` it emits (`record-review`, `session-brief`, `gate-check`, and a `bloomScale` legend in `snapshot`) — render those fields; do not maintain a translation table in a skill.

Where a bare number is still allowed (three sanctioned exceptions): (1) `evaluate` skill's self-prediction question, because `predictionDelta` needs learner and tutor on one numeric scale — anchor each number with its clause in the same breath; (2) the **Bloom adjustments** line of a `progress.md` entry, written as `Label (N)` so the prose can be checked against the tracking JSON; (3) script invocations (`--tested-bloom N`), which the learner never sees.

Concept *tiers* (below) are a separate, coarser vocabulary for module rollups — *Solid / Working / Introduced* summarize a whole module; the labels above describe one concept.

## Key Principles

- Track Bloom's level PER CONCEPT, not globally
- Progression is not always linear
- Exercises should target one level above the learner's current level (ZPD alignment)
- If a learner fails at Level N, *teach* at Level N-1 to reinforce — but the recorded `bloomLevel` does not drop. It is a one-way ratchet in the implementation (`max(current, tested)`): the forgetting signal is carried by the Leitner box and the `consecutiveCorrectAtL4Plus` streak, both of which reset on a miss, not by the classification. Even `forget` skill demotes the box, never the level.

### The recorded level is what the learner demonstrated, not what they claim

`--tested-bloom N` is the level the question *actually tested at* and the answer *actually reached* — judged by you, from the exchange. A learner's assertion about their own performance ("that was definitely a Level 4 answer," "I'd have gotten it in an interview") is not evidence that it was; grade the answer they gave.

This matters more than it looks, because the ratchet above makes the write one-way and `bloomLevel >= 3` is an input to the prerequisite gate (`state-ops` KB). An inflated level does not just overstate a trophy — it silently passes the learner into a module whose prerequisite was never secured, and no later correct answer lowers it back.

## Concept Tiers (canonical — computed by `bodhi-state`, never re-derived in prose)

Every classified concept sits in exactly one tier. The ladder is ordered and evaluated top-down: the first row whose criteria hold is the concept's tier. `bodhi-state mastery` and `snapshot` compute this per concept and return per-module counts (`{unclassified, introduced, familiar, mastered}`); skills render those counts and MUST NOT infer a tier from other fields.

| Tier | Criteria | Learner-facing word |
|---|---|---|
| **mastered** | Bloom 4+ AND 3 consecutive correct at Level 4+ AND Box 4-5 AND Feynman check passed AND built with it in working code, both since the last miss | *Solid* — can debug it and explain the trade-offs |
| **familiar** | Bloom 3+ AND Box 2+ (not yet mastered) | *Working* — can use it with guidance |
| **introduced** | classified (Bloom 1+), everything below familiar | *Introduced* — can explain what it does |
| **unclassified** | Bloom 0 — no v3 writer has classified it yet | *—* (not "introduced": nothing has been observed) |

**`mastered` is the predicate; *Solid* is the display word.** The five-conjunct formula is the canonical one from the `state-ops` KB (`is_mastered`) — this table names its tier, it does not restate or fork it. The fifth conjunct (1.20.0) exists because the other four can all be earned in conversation: a level is graded from an explanation, the box from recall, the streak from quiz answers, the Feynman flag from an explain-back. *Solid* claims the learner can debug it; one exercise that ran is the least that claim can rest on. The right-hand column is display vocabulary for module rollups in any skill (`progress` skill, `evaluate` skill, `mentor` skill): the plugin's internal scales are instructor-facing instruments, and a learner reads a position ("can use it with guidance"), not a number. Always render the word with its outcome clause; the clause is what makes the word mean something.

**Solid is a claim about now, so it carries a date.** A mastered concept whose review is overdue by more than its box interval (`masteredDueForCheck`) renders *Solid, due for a check*. It stays `mastered` — access to a well-learned concept fades while its storage persists, and relearning it is fast (Bjork & Bjork, *A new theory of disuse*, 1992) — but the word stops asserting what no recent recall has shown. Tutoring systems that certify mastery re-test it on the same logic (ASSISTments' reassessment system: Wang & Heffernan, EDM 2011).

**Why `familiar` is Bloom 3 + Box 2, and not more.** The two conjuncts test different things and both are load-bearing: Bloom 3 says the learner reached the apply rung at least once, Box 2 says at least one retrieval survived a delay. Dropping either would let a single lucky answer read as *Working*. But the tier deliberately does NOT require a consecutive-correct streak or the Feynman gate — those are what separate *familiar* from *mastered*. A concept can sit at *familiar* indefinitely; that is the honest state of most working knowledge.

**Unclassified is not a zero.** A module whose concepts are all Bloom 0 has not been failed, it has not been *reached* — which is why `masteryPct` is `null` rather than `0` there (`state-ops` KB legacy display rule) and why the tier is rendered `—`. Displaying a score for untouched material tells a learner they fell short of something they never attempted.
