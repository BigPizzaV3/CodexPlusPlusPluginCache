"""Stop hook: schema safety net for BodhiKit tracking files.

Runs `bodhi-state verify` on any learning project THIS session could have
touched — under the working directory or under the per-repo
`.bodhikit/config.json` projectRoot — whose tracking files changed recently.
Global `~/.bodhikit/config.json` searchPaths are deliberately not walked: a
project studied in another terminal must not block an unrelated session's
stop with a repair or a revision sheet it has no context to write.
If a file is structurally broken, or THIS SESSION studied a project (its
transcript shows bodhi-state `touch-state` — the closing bookkeeping every
study skill performs) and the project has no revision sheet for today (the
learner's take-home; see skills/reflect/references/revision-sheet.md), the
hook blocks the stop once and tells the model what to write or fix.

The Stop event fires at the end of EVERY assistant turn, not at "session
end", and other sessions may have studied the same projects earlier today.
So the sheet requirement is scoped by the session transcript: a project this
session never wrote to is never this session's to summarise (1.18.1 — the
first release blocked a /continue menu turn with two sheets from other
sessions).

Fail-open by design: any unexpected error exits 0 (never trap the user in a
loop), `stop_hook_active` short-circuits re-entry, and the project search is
bounded by depth, by a wall-clock budget, and by a prune list so a large home
directory cannot push the hook past its timeout.
