# Skills And Updates

Soku distributes two kinds of local agent skills:

- Bundled meta skill: `soku` teaches the CLI basics and references.
- Business skills: catalog skills installed as `soku-<slug>`, for example
  `soku-ads-report`.

## Install

Install the bundled meta skill:

```bash
soku skill install
soku skill install --global
soku skill install --agent claude --global
```

Install business skills:

```bash
soku skill list
soku skill install account-audit
soku skill install ads-report google-ads
soku skill install --all
soku skill status
soku skill list-installed
```

Business skill install automatically ensures the `soku` meta skill exists.
Installed business skill names are Soku-prefixed:

```text
use @soku-ads-report skill
```

Use catalog slugs for install/remove (`ads-report`) and agent names for
invocation (`soku-ads-report`).

## Update

```bash
soku update status
soku update skills
soku update cli
```

Normal `soku` commands schedule a background skill refresh at most once every 24
hours. Controls:

```bash
SOKU_NO_SKILL_AUTO_UPDATE=1
SOKU_UPDATE_INTERVAL_HOURS=6
SOKU_AUTO_UPDATE_CLI=1
```

The CLI binary itself is advisory by default. Run `soku update cli` to install
the latest npm package unless the user explicitly opted into auto CLI updates.

## Legacy Meta-Only Installs

Older installations may have only:

```text
<skillsDir>/soku/SKILL.md
```

with no `.soku-skills.json` manifest and no `references/` directory.
`soku update skills` detects those legacy meta-only installs, refreshes
`SKILL.md`, copies `references/`, and writes a Soku-managed manifest entry.

Global `npm i -g @soku-ai/cli` also refreshes already-installed global meta
skills after npm finishes installing. It does not install new business skills
and does not scan project-local directories.

`soku update cli` runs that same global `npm i -g` under the hood, so its JSON
result includes `mustRereadMetaSkill` and `metaSkillRefreshed: [<paths>]`. When
`mustRereadMetaSkill` is true, re-read this skill from the listed path(s)
before continuing — the on-disk copy just changed underneath this session.

## Remove

```bash
soku skill remove ads-report
soku skill remove soku
```

Removing the last Soku-managed skill removes the local `.soku-skills.json`
manifest.

## After Upgrading The CLI

An upgrade can add, change, or retire capabilities, which invalidates whatever
this session believed the CLI could do. Ask the CLI itself rather than guessing:

```bash
soku changelog --since <the version you upgraded from> --summary
soku changelog --since <the version you upgraded from>
```

`--summary` gives counts per version; without it, each entry lists the actions
that were added or removed and, for a surviving action, which fields changed.
Output is the usual JSON envelope in a non-TTY context, so it can be parsed.

The changelog is bundled with the installed CLI, so it always describes the
binary that is running and needs no network call. It cannot speak for versions
older than its `historyStartsAt`; when `--since` reaches past that, the response
sets `truncated: true` and says so rather than implying nothing changed.

This skill records the CLI release it was written against in the line right
under its title. If the installed CLI is newer, run the command
above before relying on details in these reference files.
