# Soku CLI

Written against Soku CLI release 0.1.0-alpha.18. If `soku --version` reports a
newer release, run `soku changelog --since` that release before relying on
details here.

The `soku` CLI is the shell-native way for an AI agent to use Soku from your
coding agent or any terminal. It talks to Soku over `/api/cli/*`; no MCP
host is required. Treat this file as the router. Load the relevant reference
file before acting on a detailed workflow.

## Reference Router

Read only the reference files needed for the user's task:

| Task | Read |
| --- | --- |
| First-time setup, expired token, workspace selection, org/brand ambiguity | `references/auth-workspace.md` |
| Ads, GA4, or PostHog reads; raw `soku call`; command discovery | `references/data-capabilities.md` and `references/capability-flow.md` |
| Meta/Google/ChatGPT Ads writes, uploads, bulk create, review-gated approval | `references/ads-write.md` |
| SEO Hosting, automations, Context Hub files, temporary public file URLs | `references/seo-automation-files.md` |
| Third-party APIs through server-side credential injection; security rules | `references/egress-security.md` |
| Installing, updating, or removing Soku-managed local skills; finding out what an upgrade changed | `references/skills-updates.md` |

For an installed business skill such as `soku-ads-report`, read that skill too.
Business skills carry their own "Running this skill with the Soku CLI" section.

## Prerequisite: The CLI Must Be Installed

This skill only describes the `soku` command; it does not contain it. Check
first:

```bash
soku --version
```

If the command is missing, install it (Node.js 20 or newer is required) and
check again:

```bash
npm i -g @soku-ai/cli
soku --version
```

If npm says `@soku-ai/cli` is not found, report that the official package is
unavailable. Do not invent an unofficial package name.

When this skill arrived as a marketplace plugin, the CLI may also have
installed its own copy under `~/.claude/skills/soku/`,
`~/.codex/skills/soku/`, or `~/.cursor/skills/soku/`. Both copies are the same
document at possibly different versions. The copy the CLI installed is refreshed
together with the binary, so when the two disagree, prefer that one, and treat
`soku --help` and `soku changelog` as the authority over either copy.

## Default Flow

1. Check auth/workspace state:

```bash
soku auth status
soku workspace status
```

2. If auth is missing or expired, use the agent split-flow from
`references/auth-workspace.md`.

3. If the workspace is not ready, resolve and select the remote Soku brand:

```bash
soku workspace resolve <brand>
soku workspace use-brand <brand>
```

4. Pick the reference for the task. Do not infer Soku org/brand from the current
local repo directory.

5. Inspect command help before unfamiliar calls:

```bash
soku --help
soku <namespace> --help
soku <namespace> <action> --help
```

6. Run the command and parse JSON output. In non-TTY contexts, success is
`{"ok":true,"data":...}` and errors are `{"ok":false,"error":...}`.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Confirm the target brand immediately before any write, and read it back
  after.** Run `soku workspace status` in the same turn as the write — not
  earlier in the session — and check the reported brand is the one the user
  named (its `source` field tells you whether saved config or a `SOKU_BRAND_ID`
  environment variable decided it, which is what you would have to change). The
  CLI keeps whatever brand was selected last, and it does not follow the brand
  the user is looking at in the web app, so a brand confirmed three turns ago
  proves nothing about this write. After the write, read the object back
  (`soku automation get`, `soku context list`, `soku seo-hosting pages list`)
  and confirm it landed where you intended. A write into the wrong brand
  succeeds silently and looks identical to a correct one; the read-back is the
  only thing that tells them apart.
- Never print or persist the Soku access token.
- Never ask the user to paste third-party provider keys for covered providers.
- Do not fail just because an upstream provider key env var is unset. Use
  `soku egress -- curl ...` for covered third-party APIs.
- A human must authorize every review-gated write — but don't force a
  copy-paste. If your harness prompts for explicit human confirmation before
  each shell command (a per-command permission prompt), you MAY run
  `soku review approve <id>` yourself after showing the user the diff/summary;
  that confirmation prompt is the human gate. Never allowlist or auto-approve
  `soku review approve`/`deny`, and never approve a write the user has not seen.
  If your harness runs commands without per-command human confirmation, do NOT
  self-approve — surface the `review_id` for the user to run.
- Pass user values as separate argv elements. Do not build a shell command by
  string-concatenating untrusted values.
- Do not scan local repo files, `AGENTS.md`, or `context/` folders for Soku
  workspace state unless the user explicitly asks about local files.
- When a command prints a hint, follow it before retrying. Do not loop blindly.

## Exit Codes

| Exit | Meaning | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Success | Parse `data`. |
| 1 | Usage or no workspace | Fix args, or run `soku workspace status` / `use-brand`. |
| 2 | Auth missing, expired, or revoked | Run `soku auth login --no-wait`. |
| 4 | Not found or unknown capability | Re-check `soku --help` / `soku <ns> --help`. |
| 5 | Runtime or network failure | Retry if transient; if behind a proxy set `ALL_PROXY`. |

## Capability Discovery

Typed command names are kebab-case:

```bash
soku ads query-single-dimension --help
```

Raw `soku call` action names use registry snake_case:

```bash
soku call ads query_single_dimension --payload '{"account_id":"123","dimension":"campaign"}'
```

Prefer typed commands when they exist. Use `soku call` only as a forward-compatible
escape hatch for a newer action or an action not yet exposed ergonomically.

## Installed Skill Names

The bundled CLI meta skill is named `soku`. Business skills are installed with a
Soku prefix, for example `soku-ads-report` and `soku-google-ads`.

```bash
soku skill list
soku skill install ads-report google-ads
soku skill status
```

When asking an AI client to invoke a business skill, write
`use @soku-ads-report skill`, not `@ads-report`.

## Updating This Skill

`soku update skills` refreshes the bundled `soku` meta skill and every installed
Soku-managed business skill recorded in `.soku-skills.json`. It also refreshes
legacy meta-only installs that have `soku/SKILL.md` but no manifest, so older
installations receive this `references/` directory.

`soku update cli` also silently refreshes an already-installed global `soku`
meta skill as an npm postinstall side effect. Its JSON result carries
`mustRereadMetaSkill: true` plus `metaSkillRefreshed: [<paths>]` when that
happened. After running `soku update cli`, check that field: if true, re-read
this file (and `references/`) from the listed path before continuing — do not
keep acting on this session's previously loaded copy of this skill.
