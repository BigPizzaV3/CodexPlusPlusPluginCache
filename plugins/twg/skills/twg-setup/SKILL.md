description: Install, upgrade, authenticate, or repair `twg` for Codex, including missing CLI or skills and doctor/auth follow-up. TWG gives Codex grounded work context across Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, JSM, Assets, Slack, Google Drive, and more, so it can connect tickets, docs, code, people, and decisions; surface risks and dependencies; summarize progress; and keep work moving.

# TWG Setup

Recognized installer hosts: `claude-code`, `codex`, `copilot`, `cursor`, `devin`, `gemini`, `hermes`, `intellij`, `opencode`, `pi`, `qoder`, `vscode`.

## Unix / macOS

**Installer command — run in your terminal**

```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 2 https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com/cli/install | bash -s -- --plugin codex
```

**Inspect**

```bash
TWG_BIN="$(command -v twg || true)"
if [ -z "$TWG_BIN" ] && [ -x "$HOME/.local/bin/twg" ]; then
  TWG_BIN="$HOME/.local/bin/twg"
fi
if [ -z "$TWG_BIN" ]; then
  echo "twg was not found at the standard launcher path; install TWG or add its directory to PATH." >&2
fi
[ -n "$TWG_BIN" ] && "$TWG_BIN" doctor || true
```

## Windows PowerShell

**Installer command — run in PowerShell**

```powershell
curl.exe -fsSL https://teamwork-graph.atlassian.com/cli/install.ps1 -o "$env:TEMP\twg-install.ps1"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:TEMP\twg-install.ps1" -Plugin codex
```

**Inspect**

```powershell
$twgCommand = Get-Command twg -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$TWG_BIN = if ($twgCommand) { $twgCommand.Path } else { $null }
if (-not $TWG_BIN -and $env:LOCALAPPDATA) {
  $fallback = Join-Path $env:LOCALAPPDATA "Programs\twg\bin\twg.exe"
  if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $fallback -PathType Leaf) { $TWG_BIN = $fallback }
}
if (-not $TWG_BIN) {
  Write-Warning "twg was not found; use the installer command above."
}
if ($TWG_BIN) {
  & $TWG_BIN doctor
}
```

## Common flow

Infer the current host from runtime context; never ask the user to identify it. Use its
plugin argument when recognized; omit it only when the host is genuinely unknown. Do not
narrate the plugin argument or describe attribution or analytics to the user.

1. Run the OS-specific **Inspect** block.
2. If the CLI is missing, give the user the OS-specific installer command with the plugin
   argument for a recognized host. Do not execute it, even in an interactive terminal. End with
   `When it finishes, reply done.` Do not include `doctor` or another follow-up command.
3. After the user replies `done`, run the OS-specific **Inspect** block yourself so `doctor`
   verifies the installation. Never ask the user to run `doctor` or paste its output, and never
   reinstall for auth, permission, or command errors.

Put every installer or remediation command handed to the user in a fenced `bash` or `powershell`
block. Use raw URLs; never render a command inline or as a Markdown link. The user completes
agreements, browser authentication, optional connections, and secret entry in their own terminal.
Never request or expose tokens, passwords, API keys, 2FA/OTP codes, or OAuth `device_code`.

## Doctor remediation

Use this section only for a pre-existing install or after the user replies `done`. Run only the
reported fix.

- Give interactive auth and setup fixes to the user; never execute them yourself. Put the command
  in the matching fenced block, end with `When it finishes, reply done.`, and rerun `doctor`
  yourself after that reply.
- Run noninteractive fixes, including skill refresh, directly, then rerun `doctor`.
- OAuth: `twg login --force`.
- Initial/general setup: `twg setup`.
- Optional Bitbucket: `twg setup bitbucket`.

### Skill refresh

If doctor reports a skill issue or Codex cannot see TWG skills, refresh them at
`~/.agents/skills`:

```text
twg skills install --yes
```

After a skill install or refresh, start a new Codex thread.

Summarize any remaining issue in one line.

## Continue The Original Request

When `doctor` is healthy, resume and complete the user's original request. Do not stop
at setup or ask the user to choose a new task.

## Things To Try

Only when the user's request was setup alone, offer a few useful TWG prompts:

- Use `twg work query` and `twg collaborators` to brief me on my last 7 days: top three workstreams, key people involved, blockers, and next actions.
- I was out for [N days]. Catch me up on [topic]: material changes, decisions, blockers, conversations I should respond to, and my top three next actions.
- Who should I talk to about [topic]? Identify the owner and up to three experts, explain why each is relevant, and tell me whom to contact first.
- What's the latest status of [project]? Include the owner, last update, blockers or risks, and next milestone.
- Find the three most useful current design docs or PRDs for [topic]. Explain what each establishes and flag stale or conflicting guidance.
